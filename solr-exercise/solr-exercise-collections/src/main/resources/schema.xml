 To improve performance one could
  - set stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you
    only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original
    value.
  - set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the field, but only
    return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields.
  - remove all unneeded copyField statements
  - for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false
    for all general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the
    catchall "searchAll" field, and use that for searching.
  - use the ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer java client.

    <!-- Valid attributes for fields:
      name: mandatory - the name for the field
      type: mandatory - the name of a field type
      indexed: true if this field should be indexed (searchable or sortable)
      stored: true if this field should be retrievable
      docValues: true if this field should have doc values. Doc values are
        useful for faceting, grouping, sorting and function queries. Although not
        required, doc values will make the index faster to load, more
        NRT-friendly and more memory-efficient. They however come with some
        limitations: they are currently only supported by StrField, UUIDField
        and all Trie*Fields, and depending on the field type, they might
        require the field to be single-valued, be required or have a default
        value (check the documentation of the field type you're interested in
        for more information)
      multiValued: true if this field may contain multiple values per document
      omitNorms: (expert) set to true to omit the norms associated with
        this field (this disables length normalization and index-time
        boosting for the field, and saves some memory).  Only full-text
        fields or fields that need an index-time boost need norms.
        Norms are omitted for primitive (non-analyzed) types by default.
      termVectors: [false] set to true to store the term vector for a
        given field.
        When using MoreLikeThis, fields used for similarity should be
        stored for best performance.
      termPositions: Store position information with the term vector.
        This will increase storage costs.
      termOffsets: Store offset information with the term vector. This
        will increase storage costs.
      termPayloads: Store payload information with the term vector. This
        will increase storage costs.
      required: The field is required.  It will throw an error if the
        value does not exist
      default: a value that should be used if no value is specified
        when adding a document.
